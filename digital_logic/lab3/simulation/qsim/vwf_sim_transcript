Determining the location of the ModelSim executable...

Using: /opt/intelFPGA/23.1/questa_fse/linux_x86_64/

To specify a ModelSim executable directory, select: Tools -> Options -> EDA Tool Options
Note: if both Questa Intel FPGA Edition and ModelSim executables are available, Questa Intel FPGA Edition will be used.
